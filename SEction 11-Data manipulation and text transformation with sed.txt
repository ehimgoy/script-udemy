Sed =Stream Editor
A stream is data that travels from:
-one process to another through a pipe
-one file to another as a redirect
-one device to another

Sed performs text transforamtions on streams.
Ex-
-Substitute some text for other text
-Remove line
-Append text after given lines

sed is a standalone utility and not a shell built in
